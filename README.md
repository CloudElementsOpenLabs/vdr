# VDRS
Cloud Elements has created a community of custom made VDRS that can be viewed, downloaded, and shared. This is an independent catalog of vdrs created by customers, partners and Cloud Elements developers. Additionally, this community supports our partners leveraging CloudElements technology.

## Contributing
To contribute we ask that you create a folder for the VDR, using pascal casing for the folder name (ex. MyContacts). The folder should contain the VDR JSON as well as a short README file with a description of what you built.
